# affirm-clone

A clone of Affirm.com's landing page. Not yet fully responsive, work in progress. The following are the remaining adjustments to be made:
- responsiveness
- font integration
- button hover coloring
- drop-down menu button in main nav
- a tags on main nav and other parts as necessary
- div container size adjustment on some heroes

Why Affirm? This is a company that was launched in 2012 when I first began dabbling with HTML and CSS. One of the first clones I built back then. I wanted to revisit the site in 2023 and re-build the landing site after 11 years of roughly any coding on my part.
